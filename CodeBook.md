Course 3 Codebook

This codebook details the column names found in 2 datasets that are output 
by the run_analysis.R script:
    - tidy_data
    - tidy_data_averages
    
Both datasets contain the same column names; the tidy_data_averages dataset
provides average values of each variable summarised by Subject and Average.

The fields are described below, with information coming from the supplied readme
files that accompany the dataset:

Subject
This is an anonymous number representing one of 30 subjects who took part in the
data collection experiment.

Activity
Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

All other columns are described below:
The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured 
at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 
3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in 
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the 
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
